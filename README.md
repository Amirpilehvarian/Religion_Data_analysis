The latest release of the Landscape Survey provides detailed information on various aspects of religious beliefs and practices in America. This includes the importance of religion in people’s lives, belief in God and the afterlife, worship attendance, and participation in religious activities. The study also investigates public opinion on religion’s impact on society, conflicts between religion and society, and the relationship between religion and life satisfaction.

Using survey responses, the report analyzes the diversity of opinion on political and public policy issues among different religious groups in the United States, including those who are unaffiliated or nominally affiliated with a religious tradition. These issues range from ideological orientation to views on social issues, government size and role, environmental concerns, and foreign affairs.

The Landscape Survey is based on a nationwide survey conducted from May 8 to August 13, 2007, with over 35,000 adult participants. Additional oversampling was conducted for Eastern Orthodox Christians, Buddhists, and Hindus. The study also incorporates data from a 2007 survey of American Muslims, conducted in partnership with other Pew Research Center projects, resulting in interviews with over 36,000 Americans in total.
